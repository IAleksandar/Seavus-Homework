                <p id="top">“The future is electric:” Audi is staying consistently true to its strategic alignment by presenting
                    the second model in its e-tron product line. The Audi e-tron Sportback is a dynamic SUV coupé
                    offering up to 300 kW of power and a range of up to 446 kilometers (277.1 miles) ( in the WLTP
                    cycle) from a single battery charge (combined electric power consumption in kWh/100 km (62.1 mi):
                    26.3 - 21.6 (WLTP); 23.9 – 20.6 (NEFZ); combined CO2 emissions in g/km (g/mi): 0). Its digital
                    matrix LED headlights are a new feature now available for the first time in a mass-production
                    vehicle. Their light is broken down into tiny pixels and can be controlled with exceptional
                    precision. This makes safe lane centering easier on narrow stretches of road and shows the position
                    of the vehicle in the lane. The Audi e-tron Sportback can be ordered as of the end of November.
                    Market introduction in Europe is scheduled for the spring of 2020.

                    The displayed vehicle shows optional equipment at extra charge. Individual equipment will be
                    available at a later date.</p>

                <p>Details for the RS 3 Sportback were revealed in December 2014. It went on sale in the first
                    quarter of 2015 and featured a 2.5 litres (2,480 cc) straight-5 engine with 367 PS (270 kW; 362 hp)
                    and 465 N⋅m (343 lbf⋅ft) of torque. The RS 3 Sportback is equipped with 7-speed dual clutch S tronic
                    transmission and quattro all-wheel drive system. Scott Keogh of Audi of America said in April 2015
                    that he's "confident" we'll see the car come to the United States.

                    In 2017, the RS3 sedan or saloon was added to the line-up. The RS3 can be ordered with a
                    fixed-suspension or an adjustable magnetic damper. Depending on the country, the RS3 can be
                    purchased with different optional packages. For example, the Black Optic package includes high-gloss
                    black 19-inch wheels, high-gloss black outside mirror covers, and a high-gloss black trunk lip
                    spoiler, while the Dynamic package consists of titanium 19-inch wheels with summer performance
                    tires, red brake calipers, and a sport exhaust system.</p>

                <p>A performance-focused Audi SQ8 was launched in June 2019 with chassis revisions, and styling and
                    technology upgrades. It features a new 4.0-litre Biturbo V8 mild-hybrid diesel engine with 429bhp
                    and 900Nm (664 lb-ft) of torque. The US model will use a Biturbo V8 with the same displacement
                    (shared with the US-market SQ7), albeit fueled by gasoline/petrol and producing 500bhp and 770Nm
                    (568 lb-ft) of torque; it will go on sale in late spring 2020. Performance is sent through the
                    8-speed Tiptronic automatic gearbox to its quattro all-wheel drive system. Euro-spec models have a
                    claimed acceleration of 0-100 km/h in 4.8 seconds (0-60 mph in 4.6 seconds) with an electronically
                    limited top speed of 249 km/h (155 mph).</p>
